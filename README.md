# Team-Profile-Generator

Team Profile Generator

## Description

Built a software engineer team generator from the command line. This application will prompt the user to answer questions about themselves and their role on the team. In this command line, you can input any amount of users. So Regardless of how big your team is, it will still generate as many team members as you need. This application also runs unit tests as well to show that the code runs how it is intended and when it done it will create and generate a html page dynamically.
